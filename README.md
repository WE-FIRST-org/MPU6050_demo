# Installation step
    If you haven't already, download Ardunio IDE and install drivers if you are on windows from silicon labs

    Download the repository as a whole, 
    and put it inside Documents/Ardunio, please include the folder that comes with the download, it is important.





# Troubleshoot

- I'm getting error during compiling

    - Check if you have the necessary libraries install, refer to the comments within the Arduino file for details

- I can't find ESP-32 on my Arduino
    - Well, we kinda did tell you to install the drivers. [**Click this link**](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/software/CP210x_Windows_Drivers_with_Serial_Enumeration.zip)
    - Then unzip the files(Extract All), then click x64 or x84 till one of them works.
